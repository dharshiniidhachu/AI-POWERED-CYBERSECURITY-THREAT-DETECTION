This project is developed in a Neura-hack 2025 by team whynot.An AI-powered cybersecurity application designed to proactively detect and mitigate various cyber threats.The proposed solution leverages advanced artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms to analyze and identify patterns indicative of cyber attacks, such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), malicious URLs, and phishing emails.By automating threat detection, CyberLock enhances efficiency, reduces the need for manual intervention, and ensures real-time monitoring and response. The system is adaptable and scalable, making it suitable for organizations of all sizes, and provides comprehensive protection for digital assets and sensitive information.Developed by the WhyNot team, CyberLock aims to stay ahead of emerging threats and offer a robust, proactive approach to cybersecurity.
